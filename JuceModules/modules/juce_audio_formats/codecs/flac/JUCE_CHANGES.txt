The files in this directory are from the FLAC 1.4.3 release downloaded in a tarball from
https://github.com/xiph/flac/releases/tag/1.4.3

They have been modified as little as possible, so that when they are included by
juce_FlacAudioFormat.cpp they compile without warnings and work correctly on the supported
platforms.

Below I will refer to the contents of the tarball as RELEASE and to our repo as JUCE.

The steps carried out when including the 1.4.3 version
* The contents of RELEASE/include/FLAC and RELEASE/include/share were copied to
  JUCE/[..]/codecs/flac
* The contents of RELEASE/libFLAC were copied to JUCE/[..]/codecs/flac/libFLAC
* The includes in all these files were retargeted, to be relative to the file that does the
  including, so that we don't have to rely on e.g. flac/libFLAC/include being among the include
  directories, like it is when building FLAC with the official makefiles. All this retargeting is
  done per-line with a Python script. All the rules used for the retargeting can be seen in the code
  excerpt at [1].
* Then I will do a compile/test/modify loop, until it works and compiles without warnings. The
  changes made are mostly C to C++ conversions like adding explicit casts, or fixing warnings, like
  eliminating always true branches that refer to preprocessor defines.
* Then I delete all library files, and only re-add those that are needed for successful compilation.
  This delete step is propagated back to older commits, so that unneeded files are never added to
  the GIT repo.
